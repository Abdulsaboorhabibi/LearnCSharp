        //Learn C#
        //    C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

        //    C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.

        // using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.

        // A blank line.C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

        // namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.
        // The curly braces {}  marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
        // class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program.
        // Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.
        //Note: Every C# statement ends with a semicolon ;.

        //Note: C# is case-sensitive; "MyClass" and "myclass" have different meaning.
